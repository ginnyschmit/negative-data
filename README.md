# negative-data
science is held back by people pursuing obvious projects that end up not going anywhere.  If we could share negative data, it could save hours, days, week, months, years of pursuing dead end paths.
The author is a scientist following a nontraditional path and wanting to help other researchers by providing a place for discussion and to cache negative data so that it can be viewed and 'peer reviewed' by others who may or may not have followed the same path leading to similar or different conclusions.  Science is collaborative and we forget that sometimes.
